You have reached the end of this course! Congratulations!!

Here are some suggestions on courses to take next. [Or follow the lovely learning paths on Frontend Masters.][paths]

- How to use a CLI, bash and Linux. [Luckily for you I already have a course on it!][linux].
- How to use Git well. [See Nina's coursea.][nina]
- Deploy your code so you can see it from the web. [I like Jem's course][jem].
- Learn some Node.js to understand how servers work. [Scott's course is amazing][scott].
- Try a framework. Good ones to try are [React (my course)][react], [Vue][vue], [Svelte][svelte], or [Angular][angular].
- Take a computer science course (not now, but in the nearish future, have some practice before going here.) [I have a course on that too.][cs]
